## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0–v3.0 decisions archived to PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

v4.0 key constraints from research:
- Phase 21: Wrap createHeroGauge() in requestAnimationFrame() to prevent Plotly zero-width render after DOM restructure
- Phase 22: Use element.style with hex from getZoneColor() — never concatenate Tailwind class strings dynamically
- Phase 23: prefers-reduced-motion guard is required on CountUp.js and gauge sweep animation (accessibility, not optional)

### Blockers/Concerns
