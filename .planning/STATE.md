# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** "Data, not opinion." Empowers laypeople to understand interest rate drivers without relying on media sensationalism or biased advice.

## Current Position

Phase: 24 of 28 (Pipeline Temporal Layer)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-26 — v5.0 roadmap created; phases 24-28 defined

Progress: [████████████░░░░░░░░] 60% (v1.0-v4.0 complete; v5.0 starting at phase 24)

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 MVP:** Phases 1-7, 19 plans, 20 days, 81 commits

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Key v5.0 constraints from research:

- Canvas 2D for sparklines — NOT Plotly (8 Plotly instances already; Firefox freezes above that)
- Per-file snapshot storage (public/data/snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD.json + index.json) with 52-file cap
- min_age_days=5 guard on read_previous_snapshot() — prevents same-week double-run treating current as previous
- Delta badge threshold |delta| >= 5 — suppresses daily ASX futures noise
- MailerLite over Mailchimp — Mailchimp free plan slashed to 500 contacts/500 emails Jan 2026

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 27]: Historical chart needs 4+ weeks of Phase 24 snapshots — ship with placeholder state; data accumulates in production after Phase 24 deploys
- [Phase 26]: 1200x630 OG image is a design deliverable (not code) — required before Phase 26 ships
- [Phase 28]: Spam Act 2003 compliance is a gating requirement — unchecked consent, double opt-in, functional unsubscribe mandatory before any emails sent
