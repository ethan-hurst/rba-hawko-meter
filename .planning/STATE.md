## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Archived to PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. All v1.0 and v1.1 decisions preserved there.

**v2.0 decisions (Plan 11-01):**
- Use [tool.pytest.ini_options] (not [tool.pytest] native TOML) for pytest 6+ compatibility
- testpaths = [tests/python] to scope discovery and keep Playwright tests isolated
- pythonpath = [.] so import pipeline.config works from flat layout (no src/)
- ruff select E/F/W/B/I/UP with no ignores (clean slate baseline)
- jsonschema included in requirements-dev.txt now (needed Phase 12) for one-command dev install

**v2.0 decisions (Plan 11-02):**
- Import pipeline.config as a module (not from...import) so monkeypatch targets module attribute
- block_network blocks localhost too — no exceptions for non-live tests (per user decision)
- FIXTURES_DIR uses Path(__file__).parent to avoid CWD sensitivity
- Fixture CSVs are real production snapshots, not synthetic data (per user decision)
- nab_capacity.csv copied in full (only 7 rows exist in production)

**v2.0 decisions (Plan 12-01):**
- No test classes — all top-level test functions per project convention
- Hand-calculated expected MAD values documented in test docstrings with full derivation
- Regression detection test uses stable-value series + spike to 10.0 at row 8, asserts z_score > 1.5
- compute_hawk_score rebalancing verified manually: (60*0.4 + 40*0.4) / 0.8 = 50.0
- Boundary tables use exact threshold values (19.9/20.0, 39.9/40.0, 59.9/60.0, 79.9/80.0)

**v2.0 decisions (Plan 12-02):**
- Use jsonschema StrictValidator (Draft7 + custom type_checker) to enforce hawk_score as Python int, not float
- Auto-fixed load_indicator_csv to return None for header-only CSV (empty DataFrame was missing correctness check)

**v2.0 decisions (Phase 13):**
- Ruff auto-fix first, then manual B904 + E501 — no noqa suppressions policy
- ESLint v10 flat config with sourceType: script for IIFE module pattern
- @eslint/js installed separately (not bundled with ESLint v10)
- builtinGlobals: false for no-redeclare to allow IIFE var re-declarations
- varsIgnorePattern for module names avoids no-unused-vars false positives
- max-len 88 for JS matching Python ruff convention for cross-language consistency
- Catch params prefixed with _ (e.g. _e) for caughtErrorsIgnorePattern

**v2.0 decisions (Plan 14-01):**
- warnings.warn(UserWarning) for endpoint unavailability — not pytest.warns() — so tests pass whether endpoint is up or down
- Shared _run_abs_test() helper for 5 ABS tests avoids duplication while keeping individual test functions
- Staleness threshold 90 days — warns but does not fail
- verify_summary.py checks only 7 gauge keys + hawk_score range — full JSON schema validation owned by test_schema.py

### Critical Context for v2.0

- `DATA_DIR = Path("data")` in `pipeline/config.py` is a relative path — all tests must patch this via autouse fixture or they silently read/write live CSV files
- ESLint v10 uses flat config (`eslint.config.js`) only — no `.eslintrc` supported; must use `sourceType: 'script'` for IIFE modules in `public/js/`
- Ruff baseline audit must run before hook is enabled — first run on unaudited codebase will produce violations; do a one-time `ruff check --fix` baseline commit first
- Live tests (`@pytest.mark.live`) must never run in the pre-push hook — only in `npm run verify` on demand
- Lefthook venv activation: configure to use explicit `.venv/bin/ruff` and `.venv/bin/pytest` paths, or document venv prerequisite

### Blockers/Concerns
