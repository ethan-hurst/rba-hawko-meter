## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0–v2.0 decisions archived to PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting v3.0:
- Patch target is `pipeline.ingest.<module>.create_session`, never the source module — wrong target produces RuntimeError even with mock in place
- `pipeline.config.STATUS_OUTPUT` is NOT isolated by the autouse `isolate_data_dir` fixture — engine tests need an explicit `engine_data_dir` fixture that also patches STATUS_OUTPUT
- `main.run_pipeline()` calls `sys.exit(1)` on critical failure — must wrap in `pytest.raises(SystemExit)` or the entire test runner terminates
- Use `MagicMock` + `create_session` patching as primary HTTP mock pattern; `responses` library available if transport-layer interception is needed but not the default
- Date-dependent CoreLogic and NAB tests must patch `datetime` at module level or use `@freeze_time` to prevent non-deterministic CI failures
- Coverage scoped to pipeline/ only via --cov=pipeline — test files excluded from measurement
- No --cov-fail-under in addopts — per-module enforcement handled by check_coverage.py script
