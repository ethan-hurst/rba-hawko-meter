## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Archived to PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. All v1.0 and v1.1 decisions preserved there.

**v2.0 decisions (pending):**
- None yet — decisions will be recorded during phase execution

### Critical Context for v2.0

- `DATA_DIR = Path("data")` in `pipeline/config.py` is a relative path — all tests must patch this via autouse fixture or they silently read/write live CSV files
- ESLint v10 uses flat config (`eslint.config.js`) only — no `.eslintrc` supported; must use `sourceType: 'script'` for IIFE modules in `public/js/`
- Ruff baseline audit must run before hook is enabled — first run on unaudited codebase will produce violations; do a one-time `ruff check --fix` baseline commit first
- Live tests (`@pytest.mark.live`) must never run in the pre-push hook — only in `npm run verify` on demand
- Lefthook venv activation: configure to use explicit `.venv/bin/ruff` and `.venv/bin/pytest` paths, or document venv prerequisite

### Blockers/Concerns

None active.
