### 🚧 v5.0 Direction & Momentum (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Transform the dashboard from a point-in-time snapshot into a momentum tracker that shows direction of change, enables organic sharing, and lays the foundation for newsletter-based monetization.

- [x] **Phase 24: Pipeline Temporal Layer** - Archive snapshots and inject delta fields into status.json (completed 2026-02-25)
- [ ] **Phase 25: Indicator Card UI** - Delta badges and sparklines on every indicator card
- [ ] **Phase 26: Social Sharing** - OG meta tags and share button for organic distribution
- [ ] **Phase 27: Historical Chart + Narrative** - Hawk score history chart and weekly change summary
- [ ] **Phase 28: Newsletter Capture + Delivery** - Email signup form and automated weekly digest

## Phase Details

### Phase 24: Pipeline Temporal Layer
**Goal**: status.json contains direction-of-change data that all frontend momentum features can consume
**Depends on**: Phase 23 (v4.0 complete)
**Requirements**: SNAP-01, SNAP-02, SNAP-03, SNAP-04, SNAP-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After each weekly pipeline run, a dated snapshot file appears in public/data/snapshots/ and index.json is updated
  2. Each gauge entry in status.json contains previous_value, delta, and direction fields populated from the prior week's snapshot
  3. The overall block in status.json contains previous_hawk_score and hawk_score_delta
  4. On the first pipeline run (no prior snapshot), all delta fields are absent and the frontend handles this gracefully with no badge shown
  5. pipeline/normalize/archive.py has unit test coverage at 85%+ enforced by the existing coverage gate
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 24-01: TBD

### Phase 25: Indicator Card UI
**Goal**: Every indicator card shows direction of change and recent trend history at a glance
**Depends on**: Phase 24
**Requirements**: DELT-01, DELT-02, DELT-03, DELT-04, SPRK-01, SPRK-02, SPRK-03, SPRK-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Each indicator card displays a directional badge (up/down/neutral) with magnitude when the delta is 5 or more gauge points
  2. The hero section displays the hawk score delta since the previous pipeline run
  3. Indicator cards with no previous value show no badge — they do not show an error or placeholder
  4. Each indicator card displays a Canvas 2D sparkline drawn from the existing history[] array, coloured by zone
  5. Indicators with fewer than 3 history points display "Building history..." text in place of the sparkline
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 25-01: TBD

### Phase 26: Social Sharing
**Goal**: Users can share the dashboard and link previews display a branded card on all platforms
**Depends on**: Phase 24 (for stable URL; OG tags themselves are independent)
**Requirements**: SHARE-01, SHARE-02, SHARE-03, SHARE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Pasting the dashboard URL into Facebook, LinkedIn, or iMessage shows a branded 1200x630 preview card with title and description
  2. Pasting the URL into Twitter/X shows a Twitter Card preview with title and description
  3. Tapping the share button on a mobile browser triggers the native share sheet
  4. Tapping the share button on a desktop browser copies the URL to the clipboard and shows a brief toast confirmation
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 26-01: TBD

### Phase 27: Historical Chart + Narrative
**Goal**: Users can see how hawk score pressure has changed over time and read a factual summary of what moved this week
**Depends on**: Phase 24
**Requirements**: HIST-01, HIST-02, HIST-03, NARR-01, NARR-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The dashboard displays a Plotly line chart of weekly hawk score values with zone colour bands in the background
  2. When fewer than 4 snapshot data points exist, the chart container shows "Building history — check back next week" instead of a chart
  3. status.json contains a change_summary array of factual, template-generated sentences describing what moved since the previous pipeline run
  4. The dashboard renders a "What changed this week" section populated from change_summary, visible below the hero
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 27-01: TBD

### Phase 28: Newsletter Capture + Delivery
**Goal**: Interested users can subscribe to a weekly data digest that delivers automatically after each pipeline run
**Depends on**: Phase 26 (share button establishes organic traffic before asking for subscriptions)
**Requirements**: NEWS-01, NEWS-02, NEWS-03, NEWS-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The dashboard displays an email signup form that submits via Netlify Forms with an unchecked consent checkbox by default
  2. Submitting the form redirects the user to a confirmation page; the submission appears in the Netlify Forms dashboard
  3. MailerLite is configured with double opt-in so subscribers receive a confirmation email before being added to the list
  4. A weekly digest email template in MailerLite auto-assembles hawk score, zone, top movers, and change narrative from status.json data
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 28-01: TBD
