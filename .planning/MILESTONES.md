## v2.0 Local CI & Test Infrastructure (Shipped: 2026-02-25)

**Phases completed:** 7 phases, 11 plans

**Key accomplishments:**
- Test foundation with pyproject.toml config hub + isolated test harness (autouse DATA_DIR/network fixtures, fixture CSVs from production snapshots)
- 60+ pytest unit tests covering Z-score, gauge, ratios, CSV handler, and jsonschema validation — the full mathematical core guarded by deterministic tests
- Dual-language linting baseline: Ruff (Python) + ESLint v10 (JS) at zero violations with unified npm scripts (lint:py, lint:js, lint)
- Live verification suite: 9 @pytest.mark.live tests for all data sources + verify_summary.py ASCII table with exit code signalling
- Lefthook pre-push quality gate running lint + unit tests in parallel, blocking broken pushes in <10s
- DATA_DIR late-binding fix across 7 modules with environment variable override support

**Stats:**
- Timeline: 2026-02-24 → 2026-02-25 (2 days)
- Commits: 64
- Files modified: 95
- Lines changed: +13,776 / -1,190
