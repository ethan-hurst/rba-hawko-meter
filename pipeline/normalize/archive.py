"""
Snapshot archival and temporal delta injection for the data pipeline.

Provides three functions:
  - save_snapshot: Archive current status dict as a dated JSON file
  - read_previous_snapshot: Load the most recent eligible prior snapshot
  - inject_deltas: Enrich status dict with delta fields from prior snapshot

All functions use Python standard library only (json, pathlib, datetime).

    list of snapshot dates. Enforces a rolling cap by deleting the oldest
    entries when the count exceeds max_entries.
